Instruction: A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination. She states it started 1 day ago and has been worsening despite drinking more water and taking cranberry extract. She otherwise feels well and is followed by a doctor for her pregnancy. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 122/77 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

Observation: Document [0] (Title: <i>Balantidium coli</i>; Rare and Accidental Finding in the Urine of Pregnant Woman: Case Report.) <iBalantidium coli</i is a ciliated protozoan parasite, which causes intestinal and extraintestinal infections in humans. It is transmitted feco-orally by ingesting infective cysts with food and water. Urinary balantidiasis may occur through contamination (direct spread from the anal area), secondarily to rectovaginal fistula and following immune suppression. Data about cases of urinary balantidiasis are rare in the world. Currently, there are no documented reports of urinary balantidiasis in Ethiopia. As our understanding, there are only eleven documented reports of urinary balantidiasis globally. However, cases of urinary balantidiasis among pregnant women have not been documented yet. The aim of this report is to alarm health professionals for considering the occurrence of such rare cases and conduct diagnosis. A 24-year old pregnant woman was admitted due to severe preeclampsia and preterm delivery at Debre Tabor Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, gynecology ward. Her urine was presented to inpatient laboratory for routine urinalysis. We detected unusual and ciliated parasite from her urine sediment characterized by its active and rotary motility through its cilia and possessing macro- and micro-nuclei, several food vacuoles and ingested red blood cells inside the cytoplasm. Hematuria, many white blood cells and epithelial cells were also detected from the urine sediment, which suggests genito-urinary tract infection due to this parasite. This rare parasite finding was confirmed to be <iB. coli</i. The route of transmission and extraintestinal existence from this woman's urine was unclear. It might be due to feco-oral transmission and spread to the genitourinary tract through direct anal contact. Moreover, it might be associated with immune suppression as she is pregnant woman.

Pregnancy causes some changes in pregnant women due to mechanical and hormonal changes that lead to ureteral dilatation and urinary stasis which in turn contribute to an increased risk of developing urinary tract infection (UTI). This study aimed to determine the frequency of urinary tract infections among pregnant women in Samawa city, Iraq, and examine the isolated organisms. In total, 210 and 55 urine samples were collected from pregnant and non-pregnant women with clinical signs and symptoms of UTI who were hospitalized in the Obstetric and Pediatric Hospital in Samawa, Iraq, respectively. The data collected from each woman included their age, gestational period, parity, level of education, and residence. The frequency of urinary tract infections among the studied woman was 86%. <iEscherichia coli</i (38.6%), <istaphylococcus aureus</i (20.4%), and <iProteus mirabilis</i (12.7%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria in the current study. According to the recorded data in this study, 86% of the infections in pregnant women occurred in the age group of 25-34 years (52.4%) and the 3rd trimester of pregnancy (49.1%). On the other hand, the results revealed that the infection rate in women with one to three pregnancies was 50.2% more than non-pregnant women. The findings of the current study showed that the highest rate of infection was observed in women who were in the age range of 25-34 years (52.4%). This can be explained by the fact that women often experience the highest reproductive activity during this period. In fact, in this period of life, women are most prone to sexual activity which predisposes them to the introduction of microorganisms to the urinary tract which causes infection. The recorded data showed that UTI became more prevalent with the progress of pregnancy, accounting for 49.1% of infections occurring in the third trimester of pregnancy.

In 1999 the Dutch College of General Practitioners (NHG) and the Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement (CBO) published revisions of their guidelines on urinary tract infections. Contrary to previous editions, the revised guidelines agree on most points, but not all. To diagnose a urinary tract infection in non-pregnant women with dysuria, the NHG guideline advises a nitrite test and a dip-slide culture if the nitrite test is negative. Although the dip-slide improves the diagnostic accuracy, a considerable number of patients have to wait at least 24 hours before therapy is given. The diagnostic approach of the CBO guideline uses only rapidly available test results, with the consequence that some women are treated despite not having an infection. The NHG guideline advocates the use of amoxicillin or nitrofurantoin for pregnant women. Amoxicillin is a questionable choice given that about 30% of isolates are resistant to it. Nitrofurantoin is in theory a correct choice. However, it is not registered for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections. In the CBO guideline amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is considered to be sufficiently safe for the treatment of pregnant women because most urinary tract infections occur after the first trimester.

Instruction: A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination. She states it started 1 day ago and has been worsening despite drinking more water and taking cranberry extract. She otherwise feels well and is followed by a doctor for her pregnancy. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 122/77 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and a gravid uterus. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?

Observation: Document [0] (Title: <i>Balantidium coli</i>; Rare and Accidental Finding in the Urine of Pregnant Woman: Case Report.) <iBalantidium coli</i is a ciliated protozoan parasite, which causes intestinal and extraintestinal infections in humans. It is transmitted feco-orally by ingesting infective cysts with food and water. Urinary balantidiasis may occur through contamination (direct spread from the anal area), secondarily to rectovaginal fistula and following immune suppression. Data about cases of urinary balantidiasis are rare in the world. Currently, there are no documented reports of urinary balantidiasis in Ethiopia. As our understanding, there are only eleven documented reports of urinary balantidiasis globally. However, cases of urinary balantidiasis among pregnant women have not been documented yet. The aim of this report is to alarm health professionals for considering the occurrence of such rare cases and conduct diagnosis. A 24-year old pregnant woman was admitted due to severe preeclampsia and preterm delivery at Debre Tabor Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, gynecology ward. Her urine was presented to inpatient laboratory for routine urinalysis. We detected unusual and ciliated parasite from her urine sediment characterized by its active and rotary motility through its cilia and possessing macro- and micro-nuclei, several food vacuoles and ingested red blood cells inside the cytoplasm. Hematuria, many white blood cells and epithelial cells were also detected from the urine sediment, which suggests genito-urinary tract infection due to this parasite. This rare parasite finding was confirmed to be <iB. coli</i. The route of transmission and extraintestinal existence from this woman's urine was unclear. It might be due to feco-oral transmission and spread to the genitourinary tract through direct anal contact. Moreover, it might be associated with immune suppression as she is pregnant woman.

Pregnancy causes some changes in pregnant women due to mechanical and hormonal changes that lead to ureteral dilatation and urinary stasis which in turn contribute to an increased risk of developing urinary tract infection (UTI). This study aimed to determine the frequency of urinary tract infections among pregnant women in Samawa city, Iraq, and examine the isolated organisms. In total, 210 and 55 urine samples were collected from pregnant and non-pregnant women with clinical signs and symptoms of UTI who were hospitalized in the Obstetric and Pediatric Hospital in Samawa, Iraq, respectively. The data collected from each woman included their age, gestational period, parity, level of education, and residence. The frequency of urinary tract infections among the studied woman was 86%. <iEscherichia coli</i (38.6%), <istaphylococcus aureus</i (20.4%), and <iProteus mirabilis</i (12.7%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria in the current study. According to the recorded data in this study, 86% of the infections in pregnant women occurred in the age group of 25-34 years (52.4%) and the 3rd trimester of pregnancy (49.1%). On the other hand, the results revealed that the infection rate in women with one to three pregnancies was 50.2% more than non-pregnant women. The findings of the current study showed that the highest rate of infection was observed in women who were in the age range of 25-34 years (52.4%). This can be explained by the fact that women often experience the highest reproductive activity during this period. In fact, in this period of life, women are most prone to sexual activity which predisposes them to the introduction of microorganisms to the urinary tract which causes infection. The recorded data showed that UTI became more prevalent with the progress of pregnancy, accounting for 49.1% of infections occurring in the third trimester of pregnancy.

In 1999 the Dutch College of General Practitioners (NHG) and the Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement (CBO) published revisions of their guidelines on urinary tract infections. Contrary to previous editions, the revised guidelines agree on most points, but not all. To diagnose a urinary tract infection in non-pregnant women with dysuria, the NHG guideline advises a nitrite test and a dip-slide culture if the nitrite test is negative. Although the dip-slide improves the diagnostic accuracy, a considerable number of patients have to wait at least 24 hours before therapy is given. The diagnostic approach of the CBO guideline uses only rapidly available test results, with the consequence that some women are treated despite not having an infection. The NHG guideline advocates the use of amoxicillin or nitrofurantoin for pregnant women. Amoxicillin is a questionable choice given that about 30% of isolates are resistant to it. Nitrofurantoin is in theory a correct choice. However, it is not registered for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections. In the CBO guideline amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is considered to be sufficiently safe for the treatment of pregnant women because most urinary tract infections occur after the first trimester.
