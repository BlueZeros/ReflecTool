Based on the 4,067 descriptions about fever in the medical records of the well-known Chinese medicine physicians throughout the ages, 19 different clinical features of fever are summarized as follows: chilly fever, high fever, low fever, dull fever, bones fever, alternating chills and fever, tidal fever, head fever, face fever, chest fever, back fever, abdomen fever, waist fever, palms and soles fever, lower extremity fever, afternoon fever, evening fever, postpartum fever, and menstrual fever. Although, some of these fever features have not be paid close attention to in Western medicine, stage-division and classification about fever in Western medicine deserve to be used by Chinese medicine for reference.
Document [1] (Title: Akhawayni and the first fever curve.) By the time of Hippocrates the typical paroxysmal fever patterns of tertian (every 48 hours) and quartan (every 72 hours) fevers caused by malaria were known. Through the ensuing centuries, ancient Greek, Roman, and Persian physicians made additional contributions to the understanding of fevers. By the end of that era, there was a working definition of what constitutes a fever, the distinction between fever as a symptom and fever as a disease, an elaborate classification scheme for multiple types of fever, hypotheses as to the causes of fever, and methods for diagnosing and treating fevers. Based on the definition of fever at that time, the 10th century ce Persian physician AkhawaynÄ« created fever curves hundreds of years before they were routinely used in the clinical setting. In HidÄyat al-Muta'allimÄ«n fÄ« al-Tibb, AkhawaynÄ« describes a system for fever curves and draws fever curves for tertian and quartan Fevers, as well as the double tertian, double quartan, and triple quartan fevers.

By the end of that era, there was a working definition of what constitutes a fever, the distinction between fever as a symptom and fever as a disease, an elaborate classification scheme for multiple types of fever, hypotheses as to the causes of fever, and methods for diagnosing and treating fevers. Based on the definition of fever at that time, the 10th century ce Persian physician AkhawaynÄ« created fever curves hundreds of years before they were routinely used in the clinical setting. In HidÄyat al-Muta'allimÄ«n fÄ« al-Tibb, AkhawaynÄ« describes a system for fever curves and draws fever curves for tertian and quartan Fevers, as well as the double tertian, double quartan, and triple quartan fevers. In this work we examine the history of fevers in the ancient world and the first description of the fever curve.

Based on the 4,067 descriptions about fever in the medical records of the well-known Chinese medicine physicians throughout the ages, 19 different clinical features of fever are summarized as follows: chilly fever, high fever, low fever, dull fever, bones fever, alternating chills and fever, tidal fever, head fever, face fever, chest fever, back fever, abdomen fever, waist fever, palms and soles fever, lower extremity fever, afternoon fever, evening fever, postpartum fever, and menstrual fever. Although, some of these fever features have not be paid close attention to in Western medicine, stage-division and classification about fever in Western medicine deserve to be used by Chinese medicine for reference.
Document [1] (Title: Akhawayni and the first fever curve.) By the time of Hippocrates the typical paroxysmal fever patterns of tertian (every 48 hours) and quartan (every 72 hours) fevers caused by malaria were known. Through the ensuing centuries, ancient Greek, Roman, and Persian physicians made additional contributions to the understanding of fevers. By the end of that era, there was a working definition of what constitutes a fever, the distinction between fever as a symptom and fever as a disease, an elaborate classification scheme for multiple types of fever, hypotheses as to the causes of fever, and methods for diagnosing and treating fevers. Based on the definition of fever at that time, the 10th century ce Persian physician AkhawaynÄ« created fever curves hundreds of years before they were routinely used in the clinical setting.
